# Logos And Icons
My personal collection of logos and icons for common coding language and framework logos. 
All logos are in an svg format to allow perfect scalability, theres at least 1 color as well as one black and white version of most of the icons.
Each folder also has an additional readme with attributation information for each of the icons that require it. I you use these icons please remember to add in this information to give attributation to the original creators of the icons. 
I did not make them, i just collected them and documented the necessary attributation where needed per open source licensing,
